# Unit-Conversation-API-Project-

Itâ€™s an API that receives a unit value (e.g. "10 kilometers") and returns its equivalent in a different unit (e.g. "6.21371 miles"). Behind the scenes, it uses precise mathematical relationships, rounding options, and context-aware logic to deliver accurate results.
